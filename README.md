# Pump The Rocket: Chaos, Stonks, and Zero Regrets

Forget balance sheets and strategy—this is raw, unfiltered market madness. Pilot your rocket fueled by hype and blind optimism, dodge bear traps, and spam the HYPE button to ignite a storm of absurd comments like “SELL YOUR HOUSE!” or “WEN MOON?!”. Either hit the moon or crash so hard you take the market with you. No brakes, no mercy, just pure stonk energy. Play if you dare. 🚀
